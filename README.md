# odin-library
Library project for practicing JavaScript, as assigned in The Odin Project.

## May 25, 2025 Update
Per the "Classes" page on The Odin Project, I've refactored the book object as a class.

## January 7, 2026 Update
As part of the page on JS Form Validation, I have refactored this again with some JavaScript Constraint Validation on the book submission form.
